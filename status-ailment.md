## Status Ailment

### Dependencies

- Challenge

### Overview

If a player has the status condition, increase the number of choices available in a challenge by one, to a maximum of 5. Status ailments may be removed mechanically or through RP at the GMâ€™s discretion.

For example:

If a challenge is set as a `1 of 3`, a player with an ailment will make a `1 of 4` instead. If the challenge were set at `1 of 5`, it will remain a `1 of 5`.
