Rulesets and Applications for the Micro-RPG System

## Introduction

The Micro-RPG System is a collection of independent rules and dependencies that can be used in combination with one another to create a custom role playing experience. The system is meant to allow for scalability, where a set of very basic rules can be used for much of a game, and additional mechanics added as needed.
