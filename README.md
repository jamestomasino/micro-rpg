Rulesets and Applications for the Micro-RPG System


## Challenge

### Introduction
This micro-system was developed to solve the following problems:

* Be usable without a character sheet
* Be usable without a pencil and paper
* Be playable anywhere
* Give a range of challenges of varying difficulty
* Attempt to limit repetitive testing (ie, rock, paper, scissors)
* Allow for some the player to have some limited freedom to affect the system

The only necessity is that you have a hand, or fingers more precisely. 

A challenge is a combinatorial that happens on one hand. You set the range of difficulty by declaring how many fingers the player may choose from: 2-5, and then informing him/her how many possible winning choices are available. To set up the test, you just hold your hand behind your back and close the fingers that are winners. (S)he guesses a finger, you reveal, and you see if it was a success or failure.  

Throughout the challenge micro-system I will number the fingers in the following way:

    1 = Thumb
    2 = Index finger
    3 = Middle finger
    4 = Ring Finger
    5 = Pinky

For example:

Lets say you want to test if your player was able to jump over a horse or something. You judge that the likelihood of that succeeding is about 40%.

You say that will be a `2 out of 5`. You put your hand behind your back and close 2 fingers. You close your thumb and middle fingers (1 & 3). He guesses 2 (Index). You reveal that he failed.

You could test `2 out of 4` as well, which tells him just ignore the pinky as a possibility. A `2 out of 4` seems like it would be the same probability as a `1 out of 2` and therefore unnecessary, but you’ll see why the distinction is important below.

#### Challenge Table

| Challenge     | Success Chance |
| :-----------: |:--------------:|
| 4 of 5        | 80%            |
| 3 of 5        | 60%            |
| 2 of 5        | 40%            |
| 1 of 5        | 20%            |
| 3 of 4        | 75%            |
| 2 of 4        | 50%            |
| 1 of 4        | 25%            |
| 2 of 3        | 66%            |
| 1 of 3        | 33%            |
| 1 of 2        | 50%            |


Ten possible scenarios of varying difficulty, and all incredibly easy to remember. Just pick the scenario that fits the difficulty you want to set. If you need an NPC to make a test, set the difficulty but have your player make the finger choices.


### Multiple Challenges

If a test should be extremely difficult, you might consider chaining multiple challenges. Requiring a `1 of 5` followed by a `1 of 3`, for instance, provides more difficulty than either test alone. This situation is best used for challenges that can have partial successes, or take place over a period of time. 

Note: multiple challenges can quickly approach impossible odds. Use this carefully.

For example: 

In a long-term challenge, you require that the player pass 4 challenges of `2 of 5`. Every test will take 10 minutes in game time. Success is guaranteed given enough time, but that may have other consequences in your story.


Integration with other Micro-Systems

### Status Ailment

If a player has the status condition, increase the number of choices available in a challenge by one, to a maximum of 5. Status ailments may be removed mechanically or through RP at the GM’s discretion.

For example:

If a challenge is set as a `1 of 3`, a player with an ailment will make a `1 of 4` instead. If the challenge were set at `1 of 5`, it will remain a `1 of 5`.
