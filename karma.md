## Karma System

### Dependencies

- Challenge System

To enable the player to have some small input we have the karma system. To use it you'll need to remember a number from 0 to 5. Every time a player fails a test, they gain 1 karma. You can keep track of these with your other hand if you're really bad at remembering things. A player may never accumulate more than 5, nor have less than 0. The one exception to the accrual of karma is in a test where you have spent karma. If you fail a test when spending a karma point, you do not earn a new one.

Before any test, a player may choose to spend 1 of his or her karma points to add one additional success to the test. If the test was a `2 of 5`, it becomes a `3 of 5`. This is where `2 of 4` and `1 of 2` become very different. A `1 of 2` would become a `2 of 2` with a karma point while a `2 of 4` would only become a `3 of 4`. 

If a challenge is ever raised to the point where the successes are guaranteed (`5 of 5`, `4 of 4`, `3 of 3`, or `2 of 2`), it is an automatic success. It is also possible to create a situation in which the player has zero chance of success without some luck (or karma) playing a vital role. To do this, simply make it a 0 success test. `0 of 5`, `0 of 4`, `0 of 3`, `0 of 2`.

Optionally, you may choose to have your players start with a number of karma at the beginning of your game session. This way they donâ€™t feel they need to fail early on to stock up.

Also optionally, you may choose to allow your players to spend more than one karma at a time. They may burn through their points faster, but may also accomplish much more heroic actions in a pinch.
