## Multiple Challenges

### Dependencies

- Challenge

### Overview

If a test should be extremely difficult, you might consider chaining multiple challenges. Requiring a `1 of 5` followed by a `1 of 3`, for instance, provides more difficulty than either test alone. This situation is best used for challenges that can have partial successes, or take place over a period of time. 

Note: multiple challenges can quickly approach impossible odds. Use this carefully.

For example: 

In a long-term challenge, you require that the player pass 4 challenges of `2 of 5`. Every test will take 10 minutes in game time. Success is guaranteed given enough time, but that may have other consequences in your story.
